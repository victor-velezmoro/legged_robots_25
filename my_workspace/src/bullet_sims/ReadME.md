In this folder i have realized Tut 2 and 3 

With the launch file my_workspace/src/bullet_sims/launch/launch.py you can easily start the visualization nodes for the robot simulation. Just select the node you want to launch.
Commands to launch the nodes:

```bash
ros2 launch bullet_sims launch.py
```
Just select the right file in the launch file. 


When testing the interactive marker, wait till the JointControler finishes its task (reaches goal position), then you can move the cube.
